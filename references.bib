	abstract = {Recent reports show that fewer adolescents believe that regular cannabis use is harmful to health. Concomitantly, adolescents are initiating cannabis use at younger ages, and more adolescents are using cannabis on a daily basis. The purpose of the present study was to test the association between persistent cannabis use and neuropsychological decline and determine whether decline is concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Participants were members of the Dunedin Study, a prospective study of a birth cohort of 1,037 individuals followed from birth (1972/1973) to age 38 y. Cannabis use was ascertained in interviews at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 y. Neuropsychological testing was conducted at age 13 y, before initiation of cannabis use, and again at age 38 y, after a pattern of persistent cannabis use had developed. Persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning, even after controlling for years of education. Informants also reported noticing more cognitive problems for persistent cannabis users. Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline. Further, cessation of cannabis use did not fully restore neuropsychological functioning among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Findings are suggestive of a neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the adolescent brain and highlight the importance of prevention and policy efforts targeting adolescents.},

	abstract = {Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for students’ learning. So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (
              n
              ≈ 350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the world’s highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60\% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.},

We investigate stereotype priming as one potential cause for lower vocabulary growth. A sample of 4th graders (N = 118) with a home language other than German from 18 elementary school classes participated in the experimental study. Students were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: After having been exposed to either explicit, implicit and no stereotype priming, the children were supposed to learn difﬁcult new words. Conﬁrming our expectations, compared to the control group condition vocabulary growth was inhibited in the priming conditions, and particularly strongly in the explicit stereotype priming condition. Supplementing other studies, we could show that students in learning situations revealed lower vocabulary growth when their belonging to the group of students with “a home language other than German” was emphasized. Unexpectedly, the effect of the treatment was not moderated by children’s ethnical identiﬁcation as German or member of their culture of origin. Implications for education of students with immigrant background are discussed.},

	abstract = {The introduction of the eight-year high school stream was considered controversial by politicians and the public, partially because of the lack of empirical data supporting the decision. The present study compared students from G8 and G9 cohorts in Baden-Württemberg regarding cognitive variables such as competence in mathematics, English reading, physics and biology as well as non-cognitive outcomes such as school related stress, health problems and leisure time activities. Based on representative data from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS; Add-on-Study Baden-Württemberg), students from four cohorts spanning 2011 to 2013 were compared. In regard to the subject-speciﬁc competences we found no differences between students from G8 and G9 cohorts in mathematics and physics, minor disadvantages for G8 students in biology and the largest disadvantage for G8 students in English reading achievement. Concerning stress and health problems we found disadvantages for G8 students, whereas effects for leisure time use remained inconsistent. Interpretations of the ﬁndings and possible implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Often, highly inferential estimation procedures for the assessment of the quality of teaching are used in the systematic observation of lessons. The validity of these procedures, however, is frequently questioned since they require a high degree of inferences on the part of the observer. The aim of the present study thus is to examine exemplarily the quality of highly inferential systems of observation within the framework of the PERLE-study by analyzing coherences with lowly inferential observation data. Based on the examples of "the use of praise" and "no disturbances", it can be shown that, basically, coherences do exist between data collected through different procedures. However, in the case of highly inferential ratings, the allocation to individual rating levels is not always unequivocal. Furthermore, it appears that the degree of coherence between lowly and highly inferential observation data also depends on how the characteristics collected through highly inferential procedures have been defined.

  abstract = {In order to use attendance monitoring within an integrative strategy for preventing, assessing and addressing cases of youth with school absenteeism, we need to know whether the attendance data collected by schools cover all students with (emerging) school attendance problems (SAP). The current article addresses this issue by comparing administrative attendance data collected by schools with self-reported attendance data from the same group of students (age 15-16) in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium (N = 4344). We seek to answer the following question: does an estimation of unauthorized absenteeism based on attendance data as collected by schools through electronic registration differ from self-reported unauthorized absenteeism and if so, are the differences between administrative and self-reported unauthorized absenteeism systematic? Our results revealed a weak association between self-reported unauthorized school absenteeism and registered unauthorized school absenteeism. Boys, students in technical and vocational tracks and students who speak a foreign language at home, with a less-educated mother and who receive a school allowance received more registered unauthorized absences than they reported themselves. In addition, pupils with school refusal and who were often authorized absent from school received more registered unauthorized absences compared to their self-reported unauthorized school absenteeism. In the discussion, we elaborate on the implications of our findings.},
